These are numbers that represent the distance values of the scan performed by the LIDAR sensor, in millimeters. Each value corresponds to an angular position, starting from the starting angle and increasing by the angular step width.

I hope this helps you decode the output of the single scan data from the LIDAR sensor. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask. ðŸ˜Š
