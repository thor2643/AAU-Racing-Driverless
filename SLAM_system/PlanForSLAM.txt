Plan for SLAM


SLAM loop:
    # Process LiDAR data (e.g., feature extraction, point cloud registration)
    # Update robot pose based on LiDAR odometry

    # Process IMU data (e.g., integrate accelerations to estimate velocity)
    # Update robot pose based on IMU integration

    # Combine LiDAR and IMU information (e.g., Kalman filter or graph optimization)
    # Update the global map

    # Visualization
